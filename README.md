# **Admin Tools – Modular, Script‑Driven Utilities for Windows**

Easily modifiable admin tools covering everything from system, rig, and network information to diagnostics and repair.

---

## **General Notes**
- **All C# code is AI‑generated.**
- **All BAT and Python scripts are hand‑written.**
- **Version 2.0 will be removed Feb 14, 2026 due to being virtually impossible to make modular, the google drive link has already been removed.**

## **Original Version (BAT Edition)**

### **Adding Custom Commands**
To create a new command:

1. Write your logic in a `.bat` file  
2. Name the file after the command you want  
3. Drop it into the commands folder  

Example:  
`SystemClean.bat` → appears as **system clean**

This version is intentionally simple and extremely easy to extend.
